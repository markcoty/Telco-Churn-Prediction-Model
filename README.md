# Telco Churn Prediction Model

## In this process, we make use of an expanded version of the Telco Churn dataset, which contains 33 columns, rather than the 21 columns found in older versions. It is linked here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abdallahwagih/telco-customer-churn

## Our goal is to train and fit a model to predict customer churn. We will try two models and choose the better one. The results are shown in the [Notebook](https://github.com/markcoty/Telco-Churn-Prediction-Model/blob/main/Telco%20Churn%20Prediction%20Model.ipynb).
